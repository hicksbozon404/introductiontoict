It must contain unique values for each row, and it cannot contain NULL values.\n* **Purpose:** Ensures data integrity by guaranteeing that each record is distinct and can be uniquely referenced. It is used to establish relationships with other tables.\n* **Example:** In a `Students` table, `StudentID` would typically be the primary key.\n\n**Foreign Key:**\n* **Definition:** A column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a link or relationship between two tables.\n* **Purpose:** Ensures referential integrity, meaning that relationships between tables are maintained. It prevents actions that would destroy links between tables (e.g., deleting a record in the primary table if it\'s referenced by a foreign key in another table).\n* **Example:** In a `Courses` table, `StudentID` (if it refers to the `StudentID` in the `Students` table) would be a foreign key, linking a course enrollment to a specific student.' },
